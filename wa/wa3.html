    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <h2 id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilium#:~:text=Lilium%20(/,%5B4%5D">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is the Introduction Section of my encyclopedia page. Here, we will discuss the basics of the topic.</p>
<p>Lilium (/ˈlɪliəm/ LIL-ee-əm)[3] is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants growing from bulbs, all with large and often prominent flowers. They are the true lilies. Lilies are a group of flowering plants which are important in culture and literature in much of the world. Most species are native to the Northern Hemisphere and their range is temperate climates and extends into the subtropics. Many other plants have "lily" in their common names, but do not belong to the same genus and are therefore not true lilies. True lilies are known to be highly toxic to cats.[4]</p>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <h2 id="section2">Description</h2>
    <p>This is the Description Section.</p>
        <p>Lilies are tall perennials ranging in height from 1–6 ft (30–180 cm). They form naked or tunicless scaly underground bulbs which are their organs of perennation. In some North American species the base of the bulb develops into rhizomes, on which numerous small bulbs are found. Some species develop stolons.[5] Most bulbs are buried deep in the ground, but a few species form bulbs near the soil surface. Many species form stem-roots. With these, the bulb grows naturally at some depth in the soil, and each year the new stem puts out adventitious roots above the bulb as it emerges from the soil. These roots are in addition to the basal roots that develop at the base of the bulb, a number of species also produce contractile roots that move the bulbs deeper into the soil.[6]
Lily, petal
The flowers are large, often fragrant, and come in a wide range of colors including whites, yellows, oranges, pinks, reds and purples. Markings include spots and brush strokes. The plants are late spring- or summer-flowering. Flowers are borne in racemes or umbels at the tip of the stem, with six tepals spreading or reflexed, to give flowers varying from funnel shape to a "Turk's cap". The tepals are free from each other, and bear a nectary at the base of each flower. The ovary is 'superior', borne above the point of attachment of the anthers. The fruit is a three-celled capsule.[7]
Stamen of lilium
Seeds ripen in late summer. They exhibit varying and sometimes complex germination patterns, many adapted to cool temperate climates.
Most cool temperate species are deciduous and dormant in winter in their native environment. But a few species native to areas with hot summers and mild winters (Lilium candidum, Lilium catesbaei, Lilium longiflorum) lose their leaves and enter a short dormant period in summer or autumn, sprout from autumn to winter, forming dwarf stems bearing a basal rosette of leaves until, after they have received sufficient chilling, the stem begins to elongate in warming weather.
Lilium candidum seeds
The basic chromosome number is twelve (n=12).[8]
In 2017, lilies ranked as the second most favorite flower among UK residents, highlighting their enduring popularity and cultural significance [9]</p>

    <h2 id="section3">Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>This is the Taxonomy Section.</p>
<p>Taxonomical division in sections follows the classical division of Comber,[10] species acceptance follows the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families,[11] the taxonomy of section Pseudolirium is from the Flora of North America,[12] the taxonomy of Section Liriotypus is given in consideration of Resetnik et al. 2007,[13] the taxonomy of Chinese species (various sections) follows the Flora of China[14] and the taxonomy of Section Sinomartagon follows Nishikawa et al.[15] as does the taxonomy of Section Archelirion.[16]

    The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, as of January 2014, considers Nomocharis a separate genus in its own right,[17] however some authorities consider Nomocharis to be embedded within Lilium, rather than treat it as a separate genus.[18][19] The Sinomartagon are divided in 3 paraphyletic groups, while the Leucolirion are divided in 2 paraphyletic groups.[20]
    
    There are seven sections:
    
    Martagon
    Pseudolirium
    Liriotypus
    Archelirion
    Sinomartagon
    Leucolirion
    Daurolirion
    There are 111 species counted in this genus.</p>

    <h2 id="section4">Etymology</h2>
    <p>This is the Etymology Section.</p>
<p> The botanic name Lilium is the Latin form and is a Linnaean name. The Latin name is derived from the Greek word λείριον leírion, generally assumed to refer to true, white lilies as exemplified by the Madonna lily.[25][26][27] The word was borrowed from Coptic (dial. Fayyumic) hleri, from standard hreri, from Demotic hrry, from Egyptian hrṛt "flower".[28] Meillet maintains that both the Egyptian and the Greek word are possible loans from an extinct, substratum language of the Eastern Mediterranean.[citation needed] Ancient Greek: κρῖνον, krīnon, was used by the Greeks, albeit for lilies of any color.[29]
    The term "lily" has in the past been applied to numerous flowering plants, often with only superficial resemblance to the true lily, including water lily, fire lily, lily of the Nile, calla lily, trout lily, kaffir lily, cobra lily, lily of the valley, daylily, ginger lily, Amazon lily, leek lily, Peruvian lily, and others. All English translations of the Bible render the Hebrew shūshan, shōshan, shōshannā as "lily", but the "lily among the thorns" of Song of Solomon, for instance, may be the honeysuckle.[30]</p>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <h2 id="section5">Ecology</h2>
    <p>This is the Ecology Section.</p>
<p>Lilies are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Dun-bar.
    The proliferation of deer (e.g. Odocoileus virginianus) in North America, mainly due to factors such as the elimination of large predators for human safety, is responsible there for a downturn in lily populations in the wild and is a threat to garden lilies as well.[31] Fences as high as 8 feet may be required to prevent them from consuming the plants, an impractical solution for most wild areas.[32]</p>

    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <h2 id="section6">Cultivation</h2>
    <p>This is the Cultivation Section.</p>
<p>Many species are widely grown in the garden in temperate, sub-tropical and tropical regions.[33] Numerous ornamental hybrids have been developed. They are used in herbaceous borders, woodland and shrub plantings, and as patio plants. Some lilies, especially Lilium longiflorum, form important cut flower crops or potted plants. These are forced to flower outside of the normal flowering season for particular markets; for instance, Lilium longiflorum for the Easter trade, when it may be called the Easter lily.
Lilies are usually planted as bulbs in the dormant season. They are best planted in a south-facing (northern hemisphere), slightly sloping aspect, in sun or part shade, at a depth 2½ times the height of the bulb (except Lilium candidum which should be planted at the surface). Most prefer a porous, loamy soil, and good drainage is essential. Most species bloom in July or August (northern hemisphere). The flowering periods of certain lily species begin in late spring, while others bloom in late summer or early autumn.[34] They have contractile roots which pull the plant down to the correct depth, therefore it is better to plant them too shallowly than too deep. A soil pH of around 6.5 is generally safe. Most grow best in well-drained soils, and plants are watered during the growing season. Some species and cultivars have strong wiry stems, but those with heavy flower heads are staked to stay upright.[35][36]</p>
